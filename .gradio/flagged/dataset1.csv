The company has 100 labor hours and 90 units of raw material. Profit on P1 is $30, and on P2 is $50. Formulate and solve the LPP.","**Detailed Solution Plan:**

1.  **Problem Type Identification:**
    This problem is a classic **Linear Programming Problem (LPP)**, specifically a **product mix optimization** problem under resource constraints. The objective is to maximize profit.

2.  **Assumptions, Variables, Constraints, and Objective Formulation:**

    *   **Assumptions:**
        *   **Linearity:** All relationships between decision variables and the objective function or constraints are linear.
        *   **Divisibility:** Products P1 and P2 can be produced in fractional units.
        *   **Certainty:** All parameters (resource availability, resource consumption rates, profit margins) are known with certainty and remain constant.
        *   **Non-negativity:** Production quantities cannot be negative.
        *   **Additivity:** The total profit is the sum of profits from individual products, and total resource consumption is the sum of consumption by individual products.
        *   All units produced can be sold.

    *   **Decision Variables:**
        *   Let $X_1$ = Number of units of Product P1 to produce.
        *   Let $X_2$ = Number of units of Product P2 to produce.

    *   **Objective Function:**
        The goal is to maximize total profit.
        *   Profit per unit of P1 = $30
        *   Profit per unit of P2 = $50
        Maximize $Z = 30X_1 + 50X_2$

    *   **Constraints:**
        *   **Labor Hours Constraint:**
            *   P1 requires 2 hours/unit.
            *   P2 requires 4 hours/unit.
            *   Total available labor = 100 hours.
            $2X_1 + 4X_2 \le 100$
        *   **Raw Material Constraint:**
            *   P1 requires 3 units/unit.
            *   P2 requires 2 units/unit.
            *   Total available raw material = 90 units.
            $3X_1 + 2X_2 \le 90$
        *   **Non-negativity Constraints:**
            Production quantities cannot be negative.
            $X_1 \ge 0$
            $X_2 \ge 0$

3.  **Sequential Solution Process:**

    *   **Step 1: Problem Definition and Data Extraction.**
        *   **Action:** Systematically identify all given parameters: resource requirements per unit, resource availabilities, and profit per unit for each product. This step has been completed in the ""Assumptions, Variables, Constraints, and Objective"" section above.
        *   **Tools/Models:** Data organization table (mental or physical).

    *   **Step 2: Mathematical Formulation of the LPP.**
        *   **Action:** Translate the problem narrative into the standard mathematical form of a Linear Programming Problem, clearly defining variables, the objective function, and all constraints.
        *   **Model Output:**
            Maximize $Z = 30X_1 + 50X_2$
            Subject to:
            $2X_1 + 4X_2 \le 100$ (Labor Constraint)
            $3X_1 + 2X_2 \le 90$ (Raw Material Constraint)
            $X_1, X_2 \ge 0$ (Non-negativity Constraints)
        *   **Tools/Models:** Standard algebraic notation for LPP.

    *   **Step 3: Selection of Solution Methodology.**
        *   **Action:** For a Linear Programming Problem with two decision variables, the **Graphical Method** is highly effective for visualization and understanding the feasible region and optimal solution. For problems with more variables or for general application, the Simplex Algorithm or specialized software is used.
        *   **Tools/Models:** Graphical Method (for manual solution or visualization).

    *   **Step 4: Model Solution using the Graphical Method.**
        *   **Action A: Plotting Constraints.**
            *   For each inequality constraint, convert it to an equality to find the boundary line.
            *   Plot these lines on a 2D graph (with $X_1$ on the x-axis and $X_2$ on the y-axis).
            *   Determine the feasible region by identifying the area that satisfies all inequalities (including non-negativity $X_1 \ge 0, X_2 \ge 0$). This region is typically a convex polygon.
        *   **Action B: Identifying Corner Points.**
            *   Determine the coordinates of all corner points (vertices) of the feasible region. These points are intersections of the constraint lines or axes.
        *   **Action C: Evaluating the Objective Function.**
            *   Substitute the coordinates of each corner point into the objective function ($Z = 30X_1 + 50X_2$) to calculate the profit at each vertex.
        *   **Action D: Determining the Optimal Solution.**
            *   The corner point that yields the maximum value for the objective function $Z$ is the optimal solution.
        *   **Tools/Models:** Cartesian coordinate system, linear algebra for finding intersection points, substitution method. Alternatively, software such as Excel Solver, Python's `scipy.optimize.linprog` or PuLP, or dedicated OR software (e.g., Gurobi, CPLEX) could be used to solve programmatically.

    *   **Step 5: Interpretation of Results.**
        *   **Action:** Clearly state the optimal production quantities for P1 and P2 and the maximum profit achievable.
        *   **Output:** Optimal values for $X_1^*$, $X_2^*$, and $Z^*$.
        *   **Tools/Models:** Linguistic interpretation of mathematical results.

4.  **Additional Data or Context Needed:**
    For the sole purpose of ""formulating and solving the LPP"" as stated, all necessary data is provided. No additional data is strictly required.

    However, for a more comprehensive real-world analysis, one might consider:
    *   **Integer requirements:** If products cannot be manufactured in fractions, the problem would become an Integer Linear Program (ILP), requiring different solution algorithms.
    *   **Demand forecasts:** Maximum demand for P1 and P2, which could introduce upper bound constraints on $X_1$ and $X_2$.
    *   **Market prices/revenue:** If the profit margins are not fixed but depend on sales volume or market conditions.
    *   **Cost of raw materials/labor:** To understand the components of profit and potential cost reduction strategies.
    *   **Alternative production methods or resource suppliers.**
    *   **Uncertainty:** Incorporating stochastic elements if resource availability or demand is not deterministic.","Status: Optimal
Optimal Total Profit = $ 1350.0
Optimal Production Quantity for P1 (X1) = 20.0 units
Optimal Production Quantity for P2 (X2) = 15.0 units
","Excellent! Let's break down this solution step-by-step so it's clear for a beginner.

First, a quick note: The problem formulation provided is for a **Linear Programming Problem (LPP)**, not an MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Program). The key difference is that an LPP allows fractional units (like 20.5 units), while an MILP would require whole numbers (integers) for some or all variables. Since the solution provides ""20.0 units"" and ""15.0 units,"" and the problem formulation didn't specify integer requirements, it's indeed an LPP. No problem at all, the explanation will still be very relevant!

Let's dive into what this solution means:

### Explanation of Your Optimal Solution

You've successfully used Operations Research to find the best production plan for your company! Here's what the solution tells you:

#### 1. The Big Picture: What Problem Did We Solve?

Your company makes two products, P1 and P2, and wants to make the most profit possible. However, you don't have unlimited resources – specifically, you have a limit on available labor hours and raw materials. This problem helped you figure out the *exact number* of P1 and P2 units to produce to maximize your profit while staying within those resource limits.

#### 2. The Objective Value: Your Maximum Profit!

*   **Optimal Total Profit = $ 1350.0**

This is the **maximum possible profit** your company can achieve given its current resources (100 labor hours and 90 units of raw material) and the profit margins for each product ($30 for P1, $50 for P2).

**What it means:** If you follow the production plan suggested by this solution, you will generate precisely $1350 in profit. You cannot make more profit than this amount without increasing your available resources or changing your product profit margins. This is the ""best case"" scenario for profit under your current conditions.

#### 3. The Decision Variables: Your Production Plan!

*   **Optimal Production Quantity for P1 (X1) = 20.0 units**
*   **Optimal Production Quantity for P2 (X2) = 15.0 units**

These are your **actionable instructions**. The decision variables ($X_1$ and $X_2$) represent the quantities of each product you should produce.

**What it means:**
*   To achieve the maximum profit of $1350, you should produce **20 units of Product P1**.
*   And you should produce **15 units of Product P2**.

This tells your production team exactly how much of each product to manufacture.

#### 4. Were the Constraints Satisfied? (And How Much Resource Was Used?)

This is where we check if your optimal plan respects the limits you set. We'll plug in the optimal production quantities ($X_1=20$, $X_2=15$) into your original constraint equations:

*   **Labor Hours Constraint:** $2X_1 + 4X_2 \le 100$
    *   Calculation: $2(20) + 4(15)$
    *   $40 + 60 = 100$
    *   **Result:** $100 \le 100$. This constraint is **satisfied**.
    *   **What it means:** Your production plan (20 units of P1 and 15 units of P2) will use **exactly all 100 of your available labor hours**. You won't have any labor hours left over, and you won't exceed your labor capacity. This resource is ""fully utilized.""

*   **Raw Material Constraint:** $3X_1 + 2X_2 \le 90$
    *   Calculation: $3(20) + 2(15)$
    *   $60 + 30 = 90$
    *   **Result:** $90 \le 90$. This constraint is **satisfied**.
    *   **What it means:** Your production plan will use **exactly all 90 units of your available raw material**. Like labor, this resource is also ""fully utilized"" and you won't have any raw material left over or go over your limit.

*   **Non-negativity Constraints:** $X_1 \ge 0, X_2 \ge 0$
    *   **Result:** $20 \ge 0$ and $15 \ge 0$. These are **satisfied**.
    *   **What it means:** You are producing positive quantities, which makes sense (you can't produce a negative amount of a product!).

### In Simple Terms:

To earn the absolute **maximum profit of $1350**, your company should produce **20 units of Product P1** and **15 units of Product P2**. When you do this, you will completely use up all your available labor hours and all your raw materials – meaning you are running your operations as efficiently as possible given your current constraints to achieve that top profit number.","from pulp import *
